# banao_notes_app_task3


## Getting Started

A new Flutter project on note application for Banao task 3.

In this task, we have made the notes application using the flutter_bloc package that helps in state management.
In this application, a user can perform CRUD activity to manipulate data and save data into Firebase Firestore and it also has
Google authentication for security purposes.
